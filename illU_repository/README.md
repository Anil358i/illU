## ✏️ How to Make Common Changes

### Change a colour
Open `src/style.css` and find `:root` at the top:
```css
:root {
  --accent: #7c5cfc;   ← change this to any colour
}
```

### Add a new chat response
Open `src/responses.js` and add inside `RESPONSES`:
```js
"my new topic": `Your reply text here`,
```
Then in `getResponse()` add:
```js
if (text.includes("keyword")) return RESPONSES["my new topic"];
```

### Change the page heading
Open `index.html` and find `<h1>` — edit the text inside.

### Change savings numbers
Open `index.html` and find `savings-pill` sections — edit the numbers.
